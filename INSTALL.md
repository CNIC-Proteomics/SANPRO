## Can I run a Python script without typing "python" before the script name?

On Unix-based systems, you can add a shebang (#!/usr/bin/env python3) at the top of your script and make the script executable using the **chmod +x script.py** command.

On Windows, you can associate the .py extension with the Python interpreter.

Then, include the path of scripts into PATH environment variable.

On Unix-based systems:
```
export PATH=${PATH}:/U_Proteomica/UNIDAD/SANPRO/basic
```

On Windows:
```
SETX PATH "%PATH%;S:\U_Proteomica\UNIDAD\SANPRO\basic"
```

Retrieve the environment variables
```
SET
```
